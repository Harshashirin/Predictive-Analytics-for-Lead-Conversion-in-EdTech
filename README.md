# Predictive Analytics for Lead Conversion in EdTech

This project involves building a predictive model for lead conversion using machine learning techniques and deploying it as a web application using Flask. The goal is to identify high-potential leads in the EdTech sector, improving lead conversion strategies. Here the project focuses on classification problem.



## Overview
EdTech companies deal with large volumes of lead data from multiple sources. However, the challenge lies in identifying which of these leads have the highest potential to convert into paying customers. In such a competitive industry, streamlining this process with machine learning models can lead to more efficient marketing strategies and optimized resource allocation. 


## Data
The dataset consists of lead-related features, including:

Lead Origin

Lead Source

Total Visits

Time Spent on Site

Last Activity

Do Not Email, etc.

The target variable is 'Converted' (0: Not Converted, 1: Converted).


## Modeling
Trained several classification models including:
#### Logistic Regression
#### SVM
#### Gradient Boosting Classifier (best accuracy)
#### Hyperparameter Tuning: Conducted hyperparameter tuning using Random Forest to improve model performance.
#### 
## Model Deployment
Web Application Development: Created a web application using Flask to deploy the model.
